# Seasonate
Pagination but for organizing episodes of series.


## Usage
- Firstly, make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
- Copy the `app.js` file to the folder that contains the movies you want to 'seasonate'.
- Then open the folder on the terminal and run `node app.js`.
- Sit back and watch the magic happen ðŸ˜Ž

## For this to work
- The movie name should be have this pattern [Movie name]S[season]E[episode][any other random text].[file extention] example StartUP.S1E9.blahblah.mp4
- The `app.js` file must be on the same folder as the movies. Movies in nested folders won't be recognised.
